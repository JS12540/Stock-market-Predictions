# Stock Market Prediction Models

This repository contains two deep learning models, one based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells and the other combining both LSTM and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells, for predicting stock market movements.

## LSTM Model

### Overview

The LSTM model is designed using LSTM cells and demonstrates an impressive accuracy of approximately 99.1%. It can be easily customized for different stock indexes and parameters such as epochs.

### Files

- **LSTM(Predictions).ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the LSTM model implementation.
- **data/**: Directory containing sample data or where you can place your dataset.
- **results/**: Directory for storing model predictions and evaluation results.
- **requirements.txt**: File listing the dependencies for running the notebook.

### Usage

1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Open and run the `.ipynb` notebook in your preferred environment.
3. Customize parameters such as epochs and stock indexes based on your requirements.

## LSTM-GRU Model

### Overview

The LSTM-GRU model combines LSTM and GRU cells to achieve an accuracy of about 99.1%. Similar to the LSTM model, it can be adjusted for different datasets and training parameters.

## Results

Both models have demonstrated a remarkable accuracy of approximately 99%, making them potentially valuable tools for stock market predictions.
